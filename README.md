# Actionman
Actionman is a little 2D action game made to learn some technologies.
It uses only the core dart language libraries and the latest HTML5 specification. In other words, it's canvas and dart:html powered.

## Work in progress
The game is not ready. There is no documentation so getting a look at the code is at your own risk. Please consider coming back in a few days!

I'm going to build it with an agile workflow. Versions will follow : "0.x.y" with 'x' the sprint number and 'y' the minor version.

 * Current version : 0.1.2 (february, 14)
 * Nightly builds version : 0.2
