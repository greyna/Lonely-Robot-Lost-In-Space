# Lonely Robot Lost In Space
Lonely Robot Lost In Space is a little 2D action game made to learn some technologies.
Until 0.3, it used **only the core dart language libraries** and the latest HTML5 specification. Anyway, it's canvas and dart:html powered.

## Work in progress
The game is not ready. There is no documentation so getting a look at the code is at your own risk. Please consider coming back in a few days!

I'm going to build it with an agile workflow. Versions will follow : "0.x" with 'x' the sprint number.

 * Previous versions : 
  * 0.1.2 (february, 14) initial commit
  * **Latest stabilized** 0.2.1 (february, 15) input and gameloop rewritten ; overall architecture improved ; game renamed as the game design is ready
 * Nightly version : 0.3 - I'm going to use [gorgonDart](https://github.com/cantidio/gorgonDart/tree/master/) from now.
