# actionman.dart
actionman.dart is a little 2D action game made to learn some technologies.
It uses only the core dart language libraries and the latest HTML5 specification. In other words, it's canvas and dart:html powered.

## Work in progress
The game is not ready. The code is not documentend so getting a look at it is at your own risk. Please consider coming back in a few days!
